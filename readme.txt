This program is used for automatically drainage networks and catchments extraction based on triangulation irregular networks (TINs) DEM. The flow direction in this approach is determined by computing the spatial gradient of triangle and triangle edges. Outflow edge was defined by comparing the contribution area that is separated by the steepest descent of the triangle. Local channels were then tracked to build drainage networks. Both triangle edges and facets were considered to construct flow path. The algorithm has been tested against ARCGIS as well as terrain map. The algorithm is a reliable approach with high efficiency to generate well-connected and coherent drainage networks.
The code is written in Fortran 90/95 and can be compiled in any platform with Fortran 90/95 compiler.
